/**
 * Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
 * Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: x = 121
 * Output: true
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: x = -121
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: x = 10
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 * Example 4:
 * <p>
 * Input: x = -101
 * Output: false
